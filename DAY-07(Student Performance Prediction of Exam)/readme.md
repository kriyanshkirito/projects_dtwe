

🎓 Student Performance Prediction System






An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts a student’s Performance Index using academic and lifestyle factors.

This project evolves from a data science workflow (EDA → Model → Evaluation) into a fully interactive web application with a custom-built UI and real-time predictions.

🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

🔹 Data Preprocessing

Categorical Encoding

Converted Extracurricular Activities (Yes/No) → (1/0)


Feature Scaling

Normalized continuous variables for balanced model performance




---

🔹 Model Selection

Although Performance Index appears categorical, it is actually a continuous variable (10–100).

✅ Chosen Approach: Regression

🤖 Models Used:

Random Forest Regressor

Decision Tree Regressor




---

📊 Evaluation Metric

Instead of accuracy, the model is evaluated using:

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
→ Measures how well predictions match actual values


✔ Achieved strong predictive performance
